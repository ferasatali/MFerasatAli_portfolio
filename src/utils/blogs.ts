        text: "Abdulla Mohammed Alshimmaria* , Armin Alibasica, Mohammed Atif OmaraAbdulla Mohammed Alshimmaria* , Armin Alibasica, Mohammed Atif Omarahe conventional fossil fuel based economy, the transition of such technologies results in structural inequality, unemployment and social imbalance <br> <br> [2]. In a certain economic setting where a disruptive technology is taking over another one, it is very valuable for decision makers, employers, managers and firms to set a standardized data about the skills and attributes of occupations in order for them to access the information related to the requirements of the emerging job market <br> <br> [3]. Taking the RE industry job market as an example, a recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows that there are 10.3 million jobs in 2017 with a growth of 5.3% <br> <br>[4]. The review also reveals that 3.4 million of these jobs are in the solar industry, which shows how important that field is, and so, the skills sets needed for this job is also important for the employees. However, the report did not show details about the UAE nor the GCC job market. Also on the other hand, the UAE and GCC lack the database which identifies the occupational tittles and the related skills sets needed for each occupation. <br> <br>The frame of reference in this research is O*NET, which is a publicly available database for examining the changes occur in occupational skill composition and to identify significant skill categories. O*NET has been used by many researchers, the analyses provided by O*NET proved to be very useful to have an understanding on how the skills and abilities required for each job have been affected by technological advancements. Several of these studies have been centered around the changes in the in the composition of jobs themselves (intensive margin) [2,5,6]. While other analysis of the extensive margin (focuses on changes over the demand and distribution of jobs) is also of interest to several researchers. <br> <br> However, the format which O*NET has is less appropriate when it comes to the extensive analysis method. The reason is that O*NET is designed to characterize the skills required for different jobs, and does not characterize the demand or prevalence of those jobs. As an example, “Software Developer” and “Project Manager” would be both shown in a single line within O*NET database and will be given the same weight, yet companies tend to employ much more developers compared to project managers. Another limitation to the O*NET database is that it was developed for the USA job market, which may contains specified-to-the-US terms and job titles, which puts boundaries to the applicability of O*NET on an international level of usage.",

        text: "The UAE Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA) announced the winners of the UAE Hackathon 2022, which was held for the fifth consecutive year under the slogan “Data for Happiness and Wellbeing”. The announcement took place during the closing ceremony held at the University City Hall of Sharjah, in the presence of H.E. Hessa Bint Essa Buhumaid, Minister of Community Development, H.E. Eng. Majed Sultan Al Mesmar, TDRA Director General, and members of the participating teams. <br> <br> The Hackathon, which was held this year with the support of the Ministry of Community Development represented by the National Program for Happiness and Wellbeing, is one of the largest competitions that drive innovation in the UAE, as it motivates university and school students, government employees, entrepreneurs, thinkers and creators to participate in designing the future, by providing innovative solutions to the challenges faced by various government and public entities and institutions in the UAE, using open data available through the UAE official open data portal (Bayanat.ae), and by relying on emerging technologies. <br> <br> The Hackathon competition included three categories this year. In the school students’ category, the Meta edu team won first place, while the Change Makers team won second place, and the third place went to metaHumans. <br> <br>  In the university students’ category, the UAEPixel team won first place, while the second place went to the Pause team, and the third place went to the surgical technology team. <br> <br> In the Entrepreneurs category, the HCMS.ai team won first place, while the second place went to the Unitors team, and the Dakher team won third place. <br> <br> In her opening speech, H.E. Hessa Bint Essa Buhumaid, Minister of Community Development, highlighted the importance of cooperation and integration between the Ministry of Community Development through the National Program for Happiness and Wellbeing, and TDRA within the framework of data for happiness and wellbeing. She said: “We are all aware of the great role of the UAE Hackathon in encouraging and promoting a culture of creativity and innovation among all groups of UAE society, as well as its active and positive role in supporting the innovation system at the state level, which is increasing every year at all levels, starting with government and federal entities, through universities, academic institutions, private sector institutions, and ending with individuals.” <br> <br> In turn, H.E. Eng. Majed Sultan Al Mesmar, TDRA Director General, said: “The Hackathon purpose has never been to start a competition and conclude it with speeches, prizes and celebrations, which, despite their importance, do not match the value of the fruitful ideas that participants in the Hackathon develop, and turn into projects that serve people and meet their needs in various aspect of life. I tell you this is only the beginning.Consider the Hackathon experience as an incentive to continue the journey, because your real reward is the experience, let it fuel your tireless pursuit to achieve your dreams. Do not look at the world through the lens of success and failure. Failure is not necessarily the opposite of success, as failure may be the inevitable path to success. You have many examples of global success stories that have been achieved through a path full of failed experiences.” ",
